To set up and run the Spring Boot backend for this project, ensure you have Java 17+ and Maven or Gradle installed. Clone the repository, navigate to the backend directory, and open it in your IDE. The backend uses MongoDB as the database, so make sure a local MongoDB instance is running on the default port (27017). If necessary, adjust the MongoDB connection string in application.properties. Build the project using ./gradlew build (or ./mvnw clean install if using Maven). To start the backend server, run ./gradlew bootRun or execute the TrDemoApplication main class from your IDE. The backend will start on http://localhost:8080, exposing REST endpoints under /api/items. It supports operations like fetching, adding, updating, and deleting items. Validation is applied at the model level, and basic error handling is implemented using @RestControllerAdvice to return meaningful messages for invalid input.
